# Build logs

Zerops [build pipeline](/documentation/build/how-zerops-build-works.html) process starts by creating a service with the technology you set in your [`zerops.yml`](/documentation/build/build-config.html) file and then run the commands you defined in the [`zerops.yml`](/documentation/build/build-config.html) file.

As soon as your build commands are run, you get access to the live build log from **Builds & Deploys** tab in detail of your service.

::: warning INTERACTIVE COMMANDS
Zerops is currently not able to show graphical / interactive output, such as that from `npm install`
