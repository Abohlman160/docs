# Build logs

Zerops [build pipeline]() process starts by creating a container with the technology you set in your `zerops.yml` file and then run the commands you defined in the `zerops.yml` file.

As soon as your build commands are run, you get access to the live build log from **Builds & Deploys** tab in detail of your service.

::: warning INTERACTIVE COMMANDS
Zerops is currently not able to show graphical / interactive output, such as that from `npm install`
