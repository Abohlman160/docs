# Snapshot Backup / Restore

Zerops automatically takes daily snapshots of the entire infrastructure of each project, including its data, allowing you to restore the whole project or separate services individually to the state they were at a predetermined point in time. Snapshots are saved to a separate geographical location. You have to individually contact us and specify the concrete requirements for projects/services restoring.

A custom add-on to store snapshots for a longer time or to schedule more often will be available soon, and it'll be possible to activate for each project or service.
