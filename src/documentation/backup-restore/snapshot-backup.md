# Snapshot Backup / Restore

::: danger CURRENTLY NOT AVAILABLE
Snapshot backup will be implemented at the Release candidate stage. See [roadmap]().
:::

Zerops will take daily snapshots of the entire infrastructure of each project, including its data, allowing you to restore the entire project to the state it was in at a predetermined point in time.

This will be done automatically. An add-on to store snapshots for longer or to take snapshots more often can be activated for each project.

Snapshots are saved to a separate geographical location.
