# Snapshot backup / restore

Zerops is be taking daily snapshots of the whole infrastructure of the whole project, including the data, allowing you to restore the whole project as it was at precise point of time.

This will be done automatically. Add-on to keep snapshots longer or take snapshots more often can be activated for each project.

Snapshots are saved to a geographically different location.
