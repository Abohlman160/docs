# Company & Users

You can register you account using your email, or by signing up using your [GitHub]() or [GitLab]() account. This will create an a company, of which you will be an administrator. You can then invite other team members. There is no limit of a number of team member you can invite, as we [encourage]() for each developer to have their own account and their own copy of a project.

::: warning On roles
Currently, in private beta, we do not have a role / restriction system implemented yet. We plan to have that done by the time of production.
