# Company & Users

You can sign up using your email or your [GitHub](/documentation/github/login-with-github.html) or [GitLab](/documentation/gitlab/login-with-gitlab.html) account. You will then be able to create a company account for which you will be an administrator. You can then invite other team members to this company account. There is no limit on the number of team members you can invite as we [encourage](/documentation/overview/made-for-developers.html#each-developer-should-have-his-own-account-no-artificial-pricing-boosting) each developer to have their own account and their own copy of each project.

::: warning On roles
Currently, we do not have a role / restriction system implemented yet. It's scheduled, and we hope to have it in the near future.
