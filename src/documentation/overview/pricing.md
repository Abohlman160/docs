### Free tier, unlimited projects, team members

As we [encourage]() for each developers to have their own account and even a copy of a project to be able to fully utilize our [local development tools](), you start with unlimited number of [projects]() and [team members]() for free.

Each [service]() you add inside those [projects]() will start for free as well and we don't talk some small game, each will usually run on at least [two containers](), each with at least 1 CPU, 1 GB ram and 5 GB of disc space.

So you can easilly have 5 copies of a project of only which the `myapp-production` version will be scaled up above the free tier and paid for.

### Automatic scaling in matter of seconds

All services are [automatically scalled]() both [horizontally]() by increasing or decreasing a number of containers or [vertically]() by separately adding or removing CPUs, RAM size or Disc space. Scaling happens in matter of seconds and is always optimized to run on the [most optimal settings](). You are then hourly billed.


### Project addons for production

For production version of you project, you can activate couple of addons:

- unique IPv4 address — $5 / month
- longer and more often backups — $10 / month
