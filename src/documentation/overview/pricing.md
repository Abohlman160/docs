### Free tier, unlimited projects and team members

As we [encourage]() each developer to get their own account and even own copy of each project to be able to fully utilize our [local development tools](), you will start with an unlimited number of [projects]() and [team members]() for free.

Each [service]() you add inside those [projects]() will start as free as well. We're not talk some small game here, each service will usually run on at least [two containers](), each of which with at least 1 CPU, 1 GB RAM and 5 GB of disc space.

So you can easily have 5 copies of a project out of which only the `myapp-production` version will be scaled up above the free tier and paid for.

### Automatic scaling in a matter of seconds

All services are [automatically scaled]() both [horizontally]() - by increasing or decreasing a number of containers - and [vertically]() - by separately adding or removing CPUs, RAM size or disc space. Scaling happens in a matter of seconds and is always optimized to run on the [best possible settings](). You are then billed hourly.


### Project add-ons for production

For production version of you project, you can activate a couple of add-ons:

- unique IPv4 address — $5 / month
- longer and more frequent backups — $10 / month
