# Made for Developers

Our goal from the beginning was to make devops as easy and straightforward for the developer as possible, it's great when you can move your infrastructure to a cloud, but not so great when you need to hire that-cloud-app certified engineer to set everything up properly.

We took 13 years of [experience]() providing managed cloud solutions for developers and made that into Zerops. We try not to only make Zerops a great solution for production, but also a helpful tool for local development. As such, we [encourange]() for each environment, for each team member to have their own copy of an infastructure, so there is no limit for a number of team members or projects you can add. On top of that, each service starts on the basic level for free.

### Empower you local development

Using our CLI, you can securately connect to your project using a built in VPN. This means you can locally connect to a database running on Zerops, so you don't need to have it running locally. Each developers can have their own copy of the project. This can also we used to securely import data to database, any service running inside the project will instantenously became securely available on your network.


### Always open to new idea

You can find our whole team on the [community Discord](), come discuss, ask questions.
