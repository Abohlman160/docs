# Use in GitHub Actions

Our zcli can be [installed](/documentation/cli/installation-authorization.html#installation) on GitHub Actions runners, enabling you to integrate deploy to Zerops to your existing actions. It is, however, preferred to [build](/documentation/build/how-zerops-build-works.html) directly on Zerops, either by connecting your service with a [GitHub repository](/documentation/github/github-integration.html) or by using [push](/documentation/cli/available-commands.html#push-project-name-service-name) command of zcli to trigger the build pipeline.

### Example: GitHub Deploy Action

It is important to add the `ZEROPSTOKEN` secret (which can be generated by clicking your avatar and going to "Access token management" inside your app.) to settings of your repository.

`zcli` can be installed either globally using `npm`, or by downloading (for example using `wget`) the binary directly from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/zeropsio/zcli/releases).

::: tip
See full [zcli](/documentation/cli/available-commands.html) [login](/documentation/cli/available-commands.html#login) and [deploy](/documentation/cli/available-commands.html#deploy-project-name-service-name-files-or-paths) documentation.
