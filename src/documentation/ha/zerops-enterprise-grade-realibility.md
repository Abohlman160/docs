We built Zerops all the way from bottom up based on 13 years of experience with hosting some of the largest ecommerce and digital platforms in central Europe through [vshosting~](https://vshosting.eu/), managing over 10 thousand of servers in our own Tier 3 datacenter. This allowed us to create powerful [high availability enabled](/documentation/ha/why-should-i-want-high-availability.html) platform with blazing fast load balancing and autoscaling capabilities and each service optimized for the best possible performance at any level of [automatic scaling](/documentation/automatic-scaling/how-automatic-scaling-works.html).
