We built Zerops from the ground up based on 14 years' experience hosting some of the largest e-commerce and digital platforms in central Europe through [vshosting~](https://vshosting.eu/), managing over ten thousand servers in our own Tier 3 data center. This allowed us to create a powerful, [high availability enabled](/documentation/ha/why-should-i-want-high-availability.html) platform with lightning quick load balancing and autoscaling capabilities and each service optimized for the best possible performance at any level of [automatic scaling](/documentation/automatic-scaling/how-automatic-scaling-works.html).
