# IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in Zerops

Each [project]() you create gets an **unique IPv6 address** assigned, this can be used to set up [direct access]() (optionally protected by a firewall) to any of the project's [services](), or to be set as your **AAAA record** and set up [domain access]().

As IPv6 is not widely used, you can activate **unique IPv4 address** for your project. This is useful for production projects, as this address can be used as your **A record**. Unique IPv4 address costs [$1 per month per project]().

If you need to access your dev / stage / preview projects, you should use [zerops subdomain]().
