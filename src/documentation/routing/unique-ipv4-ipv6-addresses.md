# IPv4 and IPv6 Addresses in Zerops

Each [project]() you create gets assigned a **unique IPv6 address** for free that can be either used to set up [direct access]() (optionally protected by a firewall) to any of the project's [services]() or as your **AAAA record** and setting up the [domain access]().

As IPv6 is not widely used, you can activate **unique IPv4 address** as a paid add-on for each project. It is helpful for production environment, as this address can be used as your **A record**. A unique IPv4 address costs [$8 per 30 days]().

If you need to access your development / stage / preview projects, you should use a [Zerops sub-domain]().
