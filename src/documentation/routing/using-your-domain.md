# Using your domain to access service

You can easilly set up routing rules â€” which domains and their locations should point to which service inside your [project]().

All you need to do it point your domains A and / or AAAA records to one of the [unique IP addresses]() assigned to your [project]().

**[Let's encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) SSL Certificate can be automatically installed for you.**

**Domain access can be enabled only on services running on HTTP ports**. Internally Zerops points all traffic to a L7 HTTP Balancer that takes care of SSL certificate installation and load balancing traffic to selected container running your app.
