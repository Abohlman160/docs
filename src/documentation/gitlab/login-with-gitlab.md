# Login with GitLab

You can sign up and then login to Zerops using your GitLab account. For signup, Zerops will only require permission to read your name and email address, additional permission will be required if you [connect]() your service with a GitLab repository.

### Loging in using email and password after sign up through GitLab

You will be able to login using your email after you set up your password, that can currently be done only by using the [forgotten password]().
