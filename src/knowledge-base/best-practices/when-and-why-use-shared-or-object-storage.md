# When and Why to Use Zerops Shared or Object Storage

The following table can help you choose the right storage type for your application.

|[Zerops Shared Storage](/documentation/services/storage/shared.html#shared-storage)                                                       |[Zerops Object Storage](/documentation/services/storage/s3.html)                                                                                    |
|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Direct access using TCP/UDP and native GlusterFS protocols.                                                                               |Access using a general HTTP/S protocol.                                                                                                               |
|Direct access to already saved files for modification.                                                                                    |The need to download files before making changes.                                                                                              |
|All project runtime services can have concurrent access to the same files.                                                              |Each project's runtime service accesses files separately.                                                                                           |
|The file system uses advisory POSIX locking (not imposing exclusive access).                                                              |No auto-locking, it's necessary to use object locking functionality.                                                                                |
|Vertical autoscaling of storage containers helps increase application performance.                                                     |Scaling is managed fully by the infrastructure without limits.                                                                                      |
|There are some fixed limits for the number of files and directories.                                                                      |No limits on the number of files.                                                                                                                  |
|Performs best, usually for smaller files.                                                                                                 |Performs best, usually for big content and high stream throughput.                                                                                  |
|You pay for vCPU, RAM, Disk, so it's ~ [10 times more expensive](/documentation/overview/pricing.html#hardware-resources-cost-and-autoscaling).|You only pay for reserved disk capacity, so it's ~ [10 times cheaper](/documentation/overview/pricing.html#hardware-resources-cost-and-autoscaling).|
|Only standard file system metadata and ACLs functionality.                                                                                |Extended customization for metadata and ACLs.                                                                                                       |
|Files are organized into a hierarchy, with directories and sub-directories.                                                               |Files are stored in a flat bucket address space, which makes it easier to locate and retrieve.                                                      |
